#### Experience
```Jio Platforms Limited
Duration: Oct 2023 - Present
Mode: On-site
Description:
- Developed advanced RAG systems for Jio products like JioRoaming, HR Assistant, and Data Curio, using prompt engineering, fine-tuning, and custom tools (PDF extraction, JSON debugger) to enhance performance and streamline processes. 
- Built a full-fledged DSPy (automatic prompt optimization) pipeline chatbot for real-time use case of JioFiber
- Developed an agentic framework on Azure Databricks.
- Additionally, worked on knowledge graphs, API integrations, and deploying scalable models, focusing on fine-tuning and optimizing pipelines to ensure smooth data flow, model efficiency, and safety compliance.

#### Projects
```
1. Jio Fiber AI Chatbot
Developed a modular and scalable chatbot for answering user queries based on JioFiber data using the DSPy framework, enabling runtime prompt optimization with a focus on prompt programming. Built a robust pipeline to handle ambiguous queries by recommending similar non-ambiguous queries, while accurately resolving complete queries using DSPy’s multi-hop strategy. Processed HTML files through custom scraping code and seamless chunking, with data stored and retrieved using Milvus vector database and retriever. Integrated Redis for semantic caching to ensure faster responses for repeated queries and Langfuse for full pipeline observability. Added a recommender system to suggest related FAQs via a "People also ask for" section and ensured support for context-aware responses by leveraging chat history. Delivered the entire solution as a professional API to the business.

2. Jio International Roaming and HR Assistant Chatbot
Developed RAG systems for JioFiber and HR Assistant chatbots, handling data processing, embedding generation (using open-source models), and storage in Milvus. For JioFiber, implemented a pipeline for accurate data retrieval, follow-up question handling, and query rephrasing, using techniques like Reciprocal Rank Fusion, Llama3, and Mistral. Addressed hallucinations, added feedback loops, and evaluated with Uptrain, monitored via Langfuse. For HR Assistant, created tools to convert complex PDFs into markdown for improved chunking and ingestion into a vector database. Applied re-ranking, rank fusion, and feedback-based personalized response reconstruction to enhance performance.

3. Data Curio
Implemented a feedback prompt to help users understand query generation issues and guide necessary adjustments.

4. Azure Databricks - Agentic Workflow
Developed an agentic framework on Azure Databricks by creating UDF tools with SQL for table data access and integrating them into a playground. Built a scheduled data processing pipeline using PySpark UDFs and Python notebooks to efficiently handle tabular data.
